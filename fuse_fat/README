- When we mkdir, sometimes we override a available directory with a new one
- Ran into problems compiling FileBench
	- Fixed errors by including #include <sys/socket.h>
		- Ran into more problems
- Attempted to use Fio to benchmark Input Output Operations
	- Couldn't figure out how to run on mounted file system rather than system itself
- diskinfo -c
	-c triggers simple measurement of the I/O read command overhead

---------Included Files:
README
design.pdf
fuse_fat.h
fuse_fat.c
Makefile
make_with_vars.sh

---------Make Filesystem:
./make_with_vars fuse_fat [block size]
clang -Wall fuse.c `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` -o fuse

---------How to Mount:
1. Create a directory to be use as a mountpoint
2. ./make_with_vars fuse_fat
3. ./fuse_fat -d [mount point]
4. Open a second terminal to use file system while debugging

Using the option -f will let you see the debug messages which are printed using printf

---------How to Unmount:
umount [mountpoint]

---------How to Clean:
make clean
rm -f fat_fuse

---------How to Test:
Case1 (512B):
	./make_with_vars fuse_fat 512
Case2 (8KB):
	./make_with_vars fuse_fat 8192
