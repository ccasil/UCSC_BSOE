---------Test:
./avg.sh [workload]   ---> makes and cleans benchmark

workload = ["io", "cpu", "split"]
test using io as input test 80/20 workload io/cpu ($ ./avg.sh io)
test using cpu as input test 80/20 workload cpu/io ($ ./avg.sh cpu)
test using split as input test 50/50 workload cpu/io ($ ./avg.sh split)

Runs 5 iterations and gathers 10 samples from Benchmark to average from
